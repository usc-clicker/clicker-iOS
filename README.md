For those new to swift all that’s really foreign is the ? and ! symbols which are called optionals. They are important to swift to allow for errors not to happen. Read up on that.

Blocks are also called closures in swift I think. Delegates remain the same. 

Swift is completely compatible with Objective-C btw! if you found an API you want to use and it’s only in Objective-C it can easily interact with all of our swift code. It’s fully compatible in every manner.

Any questions, feel free to ask me.
